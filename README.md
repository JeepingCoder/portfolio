# Patrick's Portfolio
This project was born out of a need for an easier way for employers to look over my portfolio and acchievments to better qualify me for a poistion. 
I built this project to showcase my work that I have done, skills I have attained, and the knowledge Ive gained. 
This project solves the issue of an future employee having to sort through many documents to find all of my information and qualifications.
I learned patience, box model, and perserverance through hard work and  many hours searching google. 
 This project stands out because it is very much me; from the coloring to the structured layout it shows that I am bright and happy. But also organized to help better suit the needs of a position.
